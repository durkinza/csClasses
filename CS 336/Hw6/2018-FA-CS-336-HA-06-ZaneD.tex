\section{Problems 19.09 through 19.12 from the textbook \cite{stallings}}
\subsection{Problem 19.09}
In the scenario given, it is apparent that the cracking of the user's passwords was not allowed within the company and thus should not have been attempted. The proper route to strengthening passwords would have been to set passwords requirements (i.e. must contain a capital and lower case letter, a symbol, and be longer than 8 characters) and require that everyone create new passwords that matched these standards. If the cracking of passwords was required for some reason, the employee should have requested permission from his superiors and the user's whose accounts would be tested. As shown in the firgure 19.6 \cite{stallings}[~635], personal data should be protected from unauthorized access.

Develop 3 non-trivial example scenarios in which you would need to apply ethical thinking in order to come up with the most ethical course of action. Then indicate all the current ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct statements that you believe would apply to each scenario and explain your rationale.
