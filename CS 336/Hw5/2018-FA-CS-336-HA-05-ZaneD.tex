In this article, since I do not have a partner, I will be completing both sides of the RSA Lab, along with the problems from the textbook and the review questions.

\section{RSA Lab}
I will be using two prime numbers, $p$=227 and $q$=191.
Here are the modulus and Euler totient, Modulus: 43357, Euler Totient:42940
Using these values I can generate a public and private key pair.
For my public key, I will pick a value $e$ such that it has no common factors (except 1) with the Euler totient
My $e$ is: 27
For my private key, I will find a value $d$ such that $d*e mod $Euler Totient = 1
My private key is: 12723

Since I do not have a partner, I will encrypt a message with my own public key, and then decrypt it with my private key.

My message to encrypt will be "HELLOHELLOHELLO"
The conversion process is as follows:
