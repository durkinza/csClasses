    \item [Abbreviation] 18-2202
    \item [Year Approved] 1984
    \item[Description] Idaho law 18-2202 defines the actions that are required to match that of a computer crime. The law defines that you are not allowed to knowingly access, alter, or damage any computer or computer system. The limitations of this law are that you know that what you are doing, and that you don't have authorization to do it. This law explains in detail that the act must be done for the purpose of: Obtaining money, property, or services. An act that is done for another purpose does not match this description and would therefor fall under another law \cite{Idaho182202}.

        \item [Description] Utah Computer crimes act 76-6-703 describes what actions are considered to be unlawful. This law, along with being much more descriptive than the Idaho law, covers many more acts such as the transmission or disclosure of data or technology. The Utah law expressly criminalizes alteration, destruction, copy, transmission, discovery, or disclosure of computer technology when the user knowingly commits the acts and is not authorized to do so. The law also states that if a person uses a computer service to prefer the act, and the computer service did not knowingly assist the person to commit the act, then the computer service is not guilty of violating the law \cite{Utah766703}.
