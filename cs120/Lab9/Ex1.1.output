The strlen() function returns the length of a string
E.g. the length of the string: *Test String* is 11.


The strcpy() function returns a copy of a string
E.g. a copy of Test String is the string: *Test String*.


The strcat() function returns a concatinated version of the two strings given to it 
E.g. a concatted string of *Test* and *String*
would be *TestString*.

The strcmp() function returns the character value difference of the first different letter in the two given strings 
E.g. The difference of the first different letter in *Test String* and in *Testing String*
would be at l=-73
where l>1 means that the first character that does not match is greater in string 1 and
where l<1 means that the first character that does not match is greater in string 2

The strstr() function returns a pointer to the location of a string within a larger string
E.g. The pointer to *Test String* within *A Test String that is longer*
would be 0x7ffe28053762



The length of *Test String* is *11* 
The comparison of *Test String* and *testing string* is *0* 
The concatination of *Test * and *String* is *Test String*
The copy of *Test String* is *Test String*
