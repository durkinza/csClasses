* 
* 
* 
* For a short term mission, a 2 of 3 system would be preferred. This is because in a short term mission, you are less likely to have components break down during the mission, and having 2 required components allows for a higher fault tolerance. 
* 
* 
* For a long term mission a 1 of 3 system would be preferred. This is because in a long term mission, you are more likely to have components break down during the mission. By only needing a single component running, the system is less likey to crash when components break down.
